# FiniteElementAnalysis
This is a compilation of Matlab scripts referencing class work done in my finite element 
analysis class at Vaughn College of Aeronautics and technology. 
It consists of several cases of axial strain due to loading, nodal analysis of a rod due
to torsion, heat transfer and the like.
All files here are matlab scripts
